-- CHALLENGE 1
-- 1. You need to use SQL built-in functions to gain insights relating to the duration of movies:
-- 1.1 Determine the shortest and longest movie durations and name the values as max_duration and min_duration.
SELECT 
    MIN(length) AS min_duration,
    MAX(length) AS max_duration
FROM film;

-- 1.2. Express the average movie duration in hours and minutes. Don't use decimals.
-- Hint: Look for floor and round functions.
SELECT
    FLOOR(AVG(length) / 60) AS hours,
    MOD(AVG(length), 60) AS minutes
FROM film;

-- 2. You need to gain insights related to rental dates:
-- 2.1 Calculate the number of days that the company has been operating.
-- Hint: To do this, use the rental table, and the DATEDIFF() function to subtract the earliest date in the rental_date column from the latest date.
SELECT 
    DATEDIFF(
        MAX(rental_date),
        MIN(rental_date)
    ) AS operating_days
FROM rental;

-- 2.2 Retrieve rental information and add two additional columns to show the month and weekday of the rental. 
-- Return 20 rows of results.
SELECT 
rental_date,
MONTH(rental_date) AS month,
DAYNAME(rental_date) AS weekday
FROM rental
LIMIT 20;

-- 2.3 Bonus: Retrieve rental information and add an additional column called DAY_TYPE with values 'weekend' or 'workday', 
-- depending on the day of the week.
-- Hint: use a conditional expression.
SELECT
    rental_date,
    MONTH(rental_date) AS month,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS weekday,
    CASE
        WHEN DAYNAME(rental_date) IN ('Saturday', 'Sunday') THEN 'weekend'
        ELSE 'workday'
    END AS day_type
FROM rental
LIMIT 20;

-- 3. You need to ensure that customers can easily access information about the movie collection. 
-- To achieve this, retrieve the film titles and their rental duration. 
-- If any rental duration value is NULL, replace it with the string 'Not Available'. 
-- Sort the results of the film title in ascending order.
SELECT
    title,
    COALESCE(rental_duration, 'Not Available') AS rental_duration
FROM film
ORDER BY title ASC;

-- 4. Bonus: The marketing team for the movie rental company now needs to create a personalized email campaign for customers. 
-- To achieve this, you need to retrieve the concatenated first and last names of customers, along with the first 3 characters 
-- of their email address, so that you can address them by their first name and use their email address to send 
-- personalized recommendations. 
-- The results should be ordered by last name in ascending order to make it easier to use the data.
SELECT
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    SUBSTRING(email, 1, 3) AS email_prefix
FROM customer
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

-- CHALLENGE 2
-- Next, you need to analyze the films in the collection to gain some more insights. Using the film table, determine:
-- 1.1 The total number of films that have been released.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film;

-- 1.2 The number of films for each rating.
SELECT 
    rating,
    COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating ASC;

-- 1.3 The number of films for each rating, sorting the results in descending order of the number of films. 
-- This will help you to better understand the popularity of different film ratings and adjust purchasing decisions accordingly.
SELECT 
    rating,
    COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY total_films DESC;

-- 2. Using the film table, determine:
-- 2.1 The mean film duration for each rating, and sort the results in descending order of the mean duration. 
-- Round off the average lengths to two decimal places. This will help identify popular movie lengths for each category.
SELECT
    rating,
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS mean_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY mean_duration DESC;

-- 2.2 Identify which ratings have a mean duration of over two hours in order to help select films for customers 
-- who prefer longer movies.
SELECT
    rating,
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS mean_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
HAVING AVG (length) > 120
ORDER BY mean_duration DESC;

-- Bonus: determine which last names are not repeated in the table actor
SELECT 
    last_name
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
ORDER BY last_name ASC;
